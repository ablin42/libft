# Libft
#### This is the Libft project @ 42 Paris.

Strengthen your skills learned during the C Piscine by recoding functions from the standard C library and other very useful functions. You'll be able to use these functions again and again throughout the curriculum.

#### The prototype is get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
The functions returns -1 if an error occured, 1 if it successfully read a line, and 0 if it reached the end of the file being read.
